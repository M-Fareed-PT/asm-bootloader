# 🧩 x86 Assembly Bootloader  
A handcrafted x86 bootloader written in 16-bit real mode Assembly.  
Runs directly from the first sector of a disk (MBR), prints custom messages, and demonstrates low-level OS development fundamentals.

## 🚀 Features
✔ Custom boot message  
✔ Runs in 16-bit real mode  
✔ Uses BIOS interrupts  
✔ Fits in a single 512-byte boot sector  
✔ Teaches CPU registers, stack usage, and memory layout  
✔ Loads and executes code directly from disk
